Data lakes are centralized data repositories.
 Data needed by data scientists is physically copied to a data lake which serves as a one storage environment. This way, data scientists can access all the data from only one entry point – a one-stop shop to get the right data. However, such an approach is not always feasible for all the data and limits it’s use to solely data scientists, making it a single-purpose system. So, what’s the solution? A multi-purpose data lake allows a broader and deeper use of the data lake without minimizing the potential value for data science and without making it an inflexible environment. Attend this session to learn:• Disadvantages and limitations that are weakening or even killing the potential benefits of a data lake.• Why a multi-purpose data lake is essential in building a universal data delivery system.• How to build a logical multi-purpose data lake using data virtualization.Do not miss this opportunity to make your data lake project successful and beneficial.</div><br><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Algorithmic-Trading/events/251992436/ target=blank>LIVE WEBINAR: Convex Optimization for Finance -- EXTERNAL RSVP</a></h2><div class="date_time"><strong>Date: </strong> 2018-06-27T13:00:00</div><br><div class="desc"><strong>Description:</strong> <p>Please join us for our next LIVE webinar, “Convex Optimization for Finance” at 4pm ET on June 27th!

Note: This event is for employers only. This event is not for job seekers. 


What is Metis? Metis is a Data Science educator in New York City, San Francisco, Chicago and Seattle. Our 12 week bootcamp is designed for people with a programming and math background who seek to deepen their knowledge within Data Science and pivot their careers. About 50% of our students have advanced degrees (Master's or PhD's) and about 75% come from industry. Over the course of 12 weeks, our students design & build 5 Data Science projects using real-world data. Their 5th & final "passion project" is the one demo'd at Career Day.
Our graduates have accepted Data Science positions at companies like Facebook, Capital One, Apple, Datakind, Tesla, IBM, Spotify, Buzzfeed, Booz Allen Hamilton, WeWork, GrubHub, and more. 
How does Career Day work? Once you arrive & register at check-in, you'll receive a resume book that features each of our graduating data scientists. This should serve as your guide for the evening, allowing you to review each graduate's resume & profile, as well as jot down notes so you can remember whom you'd like to meet during the networking portion. The Metis team will then give a brief welcome & explanation of the evening, and then our graduates will begin their final project presentations. After presentations, we will break into a networking hour where employers (you) are encouraged to meet the graduates. The goal is to connect you with potential candidates for your open data science jobs.
Schedule:


5:00-5:30 PM: Doors open. Grab your name tag, a resume book, and find a seat. 


5:30 PM: Graduate presentations begin


7:00-8:00 PM: Networking Hour


Food & drink will be provided throughout the evening. Metis does not charge any fees to employers who hire our graduates. 
What happens after Career Day? Our goal is to connect you with great talent, so we encourage you to follow up with any candidates of interest directly after the event. If you need any assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us.

By 2020, 85% of all customer interactions will be managed by machines without any human input. The same may very well be true for employee interaction. For this reason, coordinating with others is one of the top five skills deemed essential by the World Economic Forum.
When talking about shaping the future of work, we must now always keep the collaboration between humans and AI in mind. For example, new technologies such as chatbots, contribute to the reduction of communications between people. This then puts into perspective the question: “should we invest in creating more human connections?”.
Additionally, communication is more of a challenge than ever before, as many companies manage business globally with several offices around the world and teams have sometimes a 12-hour time difference between them. 
Should leadership adapt to remote teams? Should the HR department be more involved in the development of a collaborative culture? How will technology play a role in this future reality?
Key Takeaways:

How to create a more human experience at work in the future
How to create a collaborative environment for the transformed workplace
The difference between communication strategy for startups and corporations
How to develop communication and cognitive flexibility skills for the new type of leaders
